# üõ©Ô∏è Practical 3: 3D Rendering üõ©Ô∏è 

 Rendered a low polygon 3D propeller aircraft with a set of transformations that could be applied to the aircraft  
   
**3D shapes created:**
- Cuboid
- Traingular Prism
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Low poolygon circle

**Transformations:**
- Translate up and down the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis
- Rotate clockwise and anti-clockwise about x-axis, y-axi and z-axis

**Keys:**  
- Enter: Shows wireframe
- W: Aircraft rotates about x-axis in an anti-clockwise direction to the positive x-axis
- S: Aircraft rotates about x-axis in a clockwise direction to the positive x-axis
- A: Aircraft rotates about y-axis in an anti-clockwise direction to the positive y-axis
- D: Aircraft rotates about y-axis in a clockwise direction to the positive y-axis
- E: Aircraft rotates about z-axis in an anti-clockwise direction to the positive z-axis
- Q: Aircraft rotates about z-axis in a clockwise direction to the positive z-axis
- I: Aircraft‚Äôs y-axis position increases
- K: Aircraft‚Äôs y-axis position decreases
- J: Aircraft‚Äôs x-axis position increases
- L: Aircraft‚Äôs x-axis position decreases
- O: Aircraft‚Äôs z-axis position increases
- U: Aircraft‚Äôs z-axis position decreases
- +: Aircraft's propellers' speed increases
- -: Aircraft's propellers' speed decreases
